# My CV 

After making modifications to the CV, 

do not forget to COPY the cv to docs/Laverny_Oskar_CV.pdf, as this is the file that is linked everywhere else. 


see https://github.com/Qkessler/cv for evenutally making automatic releases of the cv. 
see https://github.com/marvinpinto/actions/blob/master/.github/workflows/pre-release.yml also
