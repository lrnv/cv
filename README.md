## An automatic CV with latex, github actions, gitinfo2, etc...

- Automatic `gitinfo2` watermark
- Automatic compolation on Github actions and permalink.
- 
Some sources that inspired me : [here](https://github.com/Qkessler/cv), [there](https://github.com/marvinpinto/actions/blob/master/.github/workflows/pre-release.yml) and [there](https://github.com/rbarazzutti/gitinfo2-latexmk).

## Workflow

- Keyword management of the bib file : add new section in the .tex if you want a new keyword. 
- Pushing updates produces new outputs automatically. 

You are free to check out the code and take it for yourself if you want.
